# Parking-Lot-System
Database Management System

Front was developed in Visual Studio using CSS, Html and JavaScript. Database used was MySQL in SQL Server Management Studio.

People can sign up or login. They will be shown a map of the parking lot. They can reserve their spot by specifying location and the time period for reservation. They can reserve online or on the gate immediately so that as they are getting from the gate to the spot selected, no one else takes up that spot. The system calculates the time period for which a car was parked and generates the fee at the time of checkout. If someone wants to reserve a spot regularly, they can link their account to their bank account and pay at the end of the month.
